create the file Place.js in model
create a model that takes State, City, Street
city and state should be required
this should be done on a branch NOT on master
push this branch to github ‘git push -u <remote> <branch>’
this branch needs to be merged to master. I can’t stop you from using git merge however this exercise is to practice pull requests. To complete this correctly merge the branch to master using the pull request system on your own repo
Lastly figure out how to submit a pull request of your master to my master on github
